# Simple non responsive Restaurant Page (Front-end using only vanilla JS)#

This is a simple static page-project for a fictional restaurant. This project was created for The Odin Project course. The **main focus** of this project is **creating** and **manupaliting the DOM using Javascript** only aswell as using **modules introduced in ES6**.

## Description

This project was made using only vanilla Javascript and CSS. All the DOM manipulation/creation is inside the JS code logic. 

The HTML page contains one single div element with an id of 'content'. This element is used as the starting point for all of the JS code. Loading the page will take the user on the Landing-Homepage of the site. On the top of the page there is a navigation bar containing the page's views. When a user clicks on a navigation tab JS will erase everything on the page and append the new-appropiate view.
